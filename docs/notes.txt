The click tracker information is collected for analysis to create a more 
efficient interface.  It allows the developers to see which menu items
are being used and which are not.

This module data is not syncronized to remote servers, as it's not 
important enough to take up sync bandwidth and processing.  Click tracking
can be collected independantly on each system.
